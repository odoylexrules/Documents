### About git:
git is a distributed version control system original developed by [Lynis Torvolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds), the original 
developer for the Linux kernel to help him manage source code associated with 
the Linux kernel. It is currently the defacto standard version control system. 

#### Purpose:
Used as a Distributed Version Control System, it allows developers with 
network access to the main repository to interact with the source code in a 
way where multiple users can contribute to the project of interest. The owner 
of the repository can accept the code by merging, pulling, and committing 
code to the project. Where others can push to a branch and see their changes 
added as the source code as a whole progresses through the developement cycle.

#### History:
Torvalds began developing git on the month of april, 2015. After BitKeeper 
became unavailable to the project, Lynis was unable to find a replacement 
for the platform that was sufficient. At that point, he began work on git 
and had named it 'git' after his own perception of himself being an 
unpleasent person. Being that of the british slang word for the same.

#### Key features:
- **Support for non-linear development**: With branches, developers can 
work on their own segments of the code, push patches, hot fixes, and 
features without too much concern about affecting the public-release, or 
anything the other developers are working on.
- **Distributed development**: Probably the main argument for git, is its 
ease of sharing the code by way of pulling changes and cloning. This permits 
new developers to join into the frey permitting the single-truth to go 
uneffected.
- **Compatibility with existing systems and protocols**: Git can be shared 
over several network protocols such as ftp, http(s), and ssh.
- **Cryptographic authentication of history**: For accounting involved in 
the development of a project, this makes life easier to pin down where 
the source code went sour and from whom it came from reliably well.

By no means is this a comprehensive list. A good dig on public documentation 
based on git will show that it is a very feature rich system packed with 
features and with a thriving eco-system of plugins and use-case strategies.
